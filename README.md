Here's hoping that MAUI won't suck as hard

# TODO:
* Fix Application.Current.Dispatcher spamming during initial logcat load
* support different ADB path
* "Clear" for search text
* "Clear" for device's log
* support "install"
* support "push"
* support some kind of device history (i.e. fast re-connect)
* support some kind of "scripting"
